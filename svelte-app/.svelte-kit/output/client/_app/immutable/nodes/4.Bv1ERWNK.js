The two biggest inspirations for my art style was the Henry Stickman series of games, I used to play these 
    a lot and would trace the characters, until I got a bit older and started adding more details and progressively turning it into my own style.

    The other main inspiration was South Park, I always liked how the show had characters with rather exaggerated features, for example huge eyes, and how characters often had hats or clothing to help distinguish them.</p><p class="svelte-1ofcfza"><img id="sprite" alt="aseprite drawing of my art style" class="svelte-1ofcfza"></p><p class="svelte-1ofcfza">Asperite is a software I first learned in January 2024, I find it very enjoyable to use and see it as a great tool for backgrounds and characters, as I have used it for all the games I created,.As for Maya/3D modelling as a whole, I am still somewhat new to the process, as we only started learning it in January 2025, however I am rather hooked and do really enjoy seeing something come together, below I will attach a folder of some miscellanous art work I have done throughout my life</p> <a download="liamTreacy_artwork.zip" aria-label="Download My Folder" class="svelte-1ofcfza"><span aria-hidden="true">⬇️</span> If you would like to access to a folder with more examples of my art, download this folder</a></div>`);function I(d){var s=g(),r=a(l(s),2);e(r,"src",`${t??""}/mayaHouse.png`);var i=a(r,2);e(i,"src",`${t??""}/pubSketch.png`);var o=a(i,3),c=l(o);e(c,"src",`${t??""}/aseprite.png`),n(o);var h=a(o,3);e(h,"href",`${t??""}/artwork.zip`),n(s),f(d,s)}export{I as component};
