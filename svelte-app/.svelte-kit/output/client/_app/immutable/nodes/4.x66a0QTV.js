The two biggest inspirations for my art style was the Henry Stickman series of games, I used to play these 
    a lot and would trace the characters, until I got a bit older and started adding more details and progressively turning it into my own style.

    The other main inspiration was South Park, I always liked how the show had characters with rather exaggerated features, for example huge eyes, and how characters often had hats or clothing to help distinguish them.</p><p class="svelte-1ofcfza"><a download="liamTreacy_artwork.zip" aria-label="Download My Folder" class="svelte-1ofcfza"><span aria-hidden="true">⬇️</span> If you would like to access to a folder with more examples of my art, download this folder</a></p></div>`);function v(d){var a=f(),o=e(n(a),2);t(o,"src",`${s??""}/mayaHouse.png`);var r=e(o,2);t(r,"src",`${s??""}/pubSketch.png`);var i=e(r,3),c=n(i);t(c,"href",`${s??""}/artwork.zip`),l(i),l(a),m(d,a)}export{v as component};
