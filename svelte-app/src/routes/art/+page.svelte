<p> I always enjoyed Drawing and Sketching since I was young, my art style is admittedly rather goofy, however it is just second nature now. The two biggest inspirations for it was the Henry Stickman series of games, I used to play these 
    a lot and would trace the characters, until I got a bit older and started adding more details, would I like to think was due to the fact I got better at drawing the older I got.

    The other main inspiration was South Park, I always liked how the show had characters with rather exaggerated features, for example huge eyes, and how characters often had hats or clothing to help distinguish them.

<p> Asperite is a software I first learned in January 2024, I find it very enjoyable to use and see it as a great tool for backgrounds and characters, as I have used it for all the games I created,.As for Maya/3D modelling as a whole, I am still somewhat new to the process, as we only started learning it in January 2025, however I am rather hooked and do really enjoy seeing something come together, below I will attach a folder of some miscellanous art work I have done throughout my life</p>

<!---oh man-->
<a href="{base}/artwork.zip" download="liamTreacy_artwork.zip" aria-label="Download My Folder"> <!---FOLDER WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED, HELP FROM LIBOR-->
    <span aria-hidden="true">⬇️</span> If you would like to access to a folder with more examples of my art, download this folder
  </a>
<!----So originally I had I created a folder on OneDrive and attached a link, however the link always seemed to not work, so then I tried downloading the folder frmo the onedrive and attaching it, i did not work,
so then I tried to create a new folder on my laptop, then port over the materials and then put it into the project, and this finally worked-->
<!----PROCESS was a lot of trial and error, I used the code Libor provided for the download and tried rework it-->
