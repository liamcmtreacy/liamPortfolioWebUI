<img id="dinglePhoto" src="{base}/dingle.png" alt="Two of my classmates and I at Dingle Animation Festival">
<p> From March 20th - 22nd 2025, I had the pleasure of attending Dingle Animation Festival as a part of my course. During this event it was amazing to meet many lovely industry professionals, who offered their advice and I was able to gain many new Linkedin connections.
    Some other highlights include learning to draw with Will Sliney, taking part in the Pitch for a Pint event and showing my ideas to an executive, and seeing the sights of Dingle, Kerry. <br>
    <a href="https://www.setu.ie/news/setu-students-shortlisted-at-dingle-animation-festival">We also had an article written about us for SETU Carlow</a>

<h2>Brownbag Films </h2> <!----Never got the photos, so just imagine a picture of me and some of my classmates outside the Studio-->
<p> On April 24th 2025, I had the pleasure of attending a Brown Bag Films event, where their staff gave talks about Storyboarding, the use of Unreal Engine in animation and Animation Directing, afterwards there was an hour for Networking where I had the chance to speak to their staff and talk, including co-founder Darrah O'Connell and Matthew Lloyd.
    I plan on attending more events in the future, and will update this as they happen.

<h1> So what exactly am I studying?</h1>
<!----For a while I debated on keeping this page or not, keeping it purely so potential employers can look easily at the course-->
<p> I am enrolled in a course in SETU Carlow called Computing in Interactive Digital Art and Design "IDAD". In this course we learn about 
    Animation, Game Design, Web Development and also learn about the industries and how to effectively work in them. I also plan to complete an animation masters in IADT.
