<img id = "dinglePhoto" src = "./dingle.png" alt = "Two of my classmates and I at Dingle Animation Festival">
<p> From March 20th - 22nd 2025, I had the pleasure of attending Dingle Animation Festival as a part of my course. During this event it was amazing to meet many lovely industry professionals, who offered their advice and I was able to gain many new Linkedin connections.
    Some other highlights include learning to draw with Will Sliney, taking part in the Pitch for a Pint event and showing my ideas to an executive, and seeing the sights of Dingle, Kerry. <br>
